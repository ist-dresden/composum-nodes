A Sling based Resource/JCR development tool, usable on both Sling and AEM. 
It contains various useful adminstration and development tools for the 
Sling framework, like a full featured JCR browser incl. component rendering and asset view, ACL manipulation, Groovy 
script execution, execution of queries, and user and package management. It also integrates some tools similar to 
the Felix console, for systems that disallow access to the console (like, for instance, AEMaaCS).

Usage: just open
